      <h2 is-upgraded>Accessing Dynatrace Environment</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Access your environment by going to this link, <a href="https://bit.ly/dt-transform"
            target="_blank">https://bit.ly/dt-transform</a></li>
        <li>Login with your credentials</li>
        <li>Go to Dynatrace Hub</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 is-upgraded>Installing OneAgent</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>In Dynatrace Hub, search for OneAgent and click on the card to access OneAgent details page</li>
        <li>Click on Download OneAgent button and it will take you to the screen where you have to choose the OS.</li>
        <li>Go ahead and select Windows.</li>
        <li>Download the installer. There are two options: <ul>
            <li>Click the Download Installer button to download the Windows installer (EXE file) for single-server
              installation.</li>
            <li>The OneAgent Windows EXE installer is preconfigured for your environment. If you need to customize it,
              you can add add the installation parameters at a Windows command line. You can also add the
              <code>--set-param=&lt;value&gt;</code> parameters on the Configure OneAgent settings installer screen.
            </li>
            <li>For more information, see Customize OneAgent installation on Windows</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="image-container"><img alt="OneAgent_Installation_Screen" src="img\30763d601ef44e23.png"></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Run the executable file and follow the displayed instructions. If your environment is segmented, for example
          into development and production, consider organizing your hosts into host groups. To do this, select the Set
          host group for this host option and provide a name. If the name you enter exists already, the host will be
          added to the group with this name. If you provide a new name, a new host group will be created. The EXE
          installer provides a quiet mode. Simply use it with command-line <code>--quiet</code> parameter.</li>
        <li>Restart all processes that you want to monitor. You&#39;ll be prompted with a list of the processes that
          need to be restarted. Note that you can restart your processes at any time, even during your
          organization&#39;s next planned maintenance period. Though until all processes have been restarted, you&#39;ll
          only see a limited set of metrics, for example CPU or memory consumption.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 is-upgraded>Next steps</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Access the Deployment Status screen.</li>
        <li>Stop and restart easyTravel UI.</li>

    <google-codelab-step label="What happens during the installation of OneAgent?" duration="0">
      <p>During the installation process, the installer</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Installs executable code and libraries that are used by OneAgent.</li>
        <li>Creates entries in the Windows Registry that start OneAgent as a SYSTEM service. Additionally, the
          oneagentmon device and WinPcap are installed to allow better integration with the operating system and to
          facilitate the capture of network statistics.</li>
        <li>Checks the system&#39;s global proxy settings.</li>
        <li>Checks for a connection to Dynatrace Server or ActiveGate (if you installed ActiveGate and downloaded the
          OneAgent installer after ActiveGate was connected to Dynatrace).</li>
        <li><code>OneAgent 1.193 and earlier</code> Creates its own user (dtuser) to run OneAgent extensions. This user
          is a member of the Performance Monitoring Users group, and can only log in as a service. The password is
          randomly generated during installation and stored encrypted. You can&#39;t change the password. For security
          purposes, the dtuser is not allowed to: <ul>
            <li>Access computer from the network.</li>
            <li>Log in as a batch job.</li>
            <li>Log in locally.</li>
            <li>Log in through Remote Desktop Services.</li>
            <li>The dtuser is required for Dynatrace to operate properly, therefore you must not delete it. If, for some
              reason, the dtuser was deleted, next update will recreate it.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><code>OneAgent 1.195+</code> For fresh OneAgent 1.195+ installations, the default
          <code>LocalSystem account</code> is used to run OneAgent extensions. For a summarized view of the changes made
          to your system by OneAgent installation, see <a
