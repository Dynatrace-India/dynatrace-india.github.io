      <google-codelab-step label="Deploy SampleApp in Jenkins" duration="5">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Login to your Jenkins Instance</h2>
<p>Access your Jenkins environment via a web browser with credentials from your email</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Jenkins-Setup" src="img\93fcfae690e6c21d.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Build a pipeline</h2>
<p>Once you logged in, mouseover &#34;<strong>DeploySockShop</strong>&#34; in the list, click on the down arrow and select &#34;<strong>Build Now</strong>&#34;</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Jenkins-Setup" src="img\47ef1758e20bf421.png"></p>
<p>This process will take about 1-2 mins so we will let it run.</p>
<p>Once finished, you can click on &#34;<strong>DeploySockshop</strong>&#34; again and see the various stages of the pipeline build.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Jenkins-Setup" src="img\74d62559d3576931.png"></p>
<p>This is just a demonstration of a working pipeline so there&#39;s no need to wait for it to complete.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Setting up Keptn" duration="5">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Login to your Kubernetes Instance</h2>
<p>Login to the Kubernetes server via a SSH terminal (eg. Putty, Terminal, MobaXterm)</p>
<p>Access your Kubernetes environment with credentials from your email</p>
<p>Once you logged in, you can issue the commands below to install Keptn<br> Part of the Keptn setup has been automated within the shell script below.</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">cd dtacmworkshop/keptn
sudo ./installKeptn.sh
</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Keptn-Setup" src="img\37c529b5234457af.png"></p>
<p>Keptn will install it&#39;s necessary components required for its setup. Setup will take a 2-3 minutes.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Keptn-Setup" src="img\d86150e79b8bed.png"></p>
<p>Once completed, take note of the <strong>keptn API token</strong> which is required for the next step. You can also use the Keptn Bridge and API Endpoint</p>
<p>For example:<br> KEPTN BRIDGE: http://bridge.keptn.<strong><em>YOUR-IP-ADDRESS</em></strong>.nip.io<br> KEPTN ENDPOINT: https://api.keptn.<strong><em>YOUR-IP-ADDRESS</em></strong>.nip.io/<strong>swagger-ui</strong>/</p>
<p><img alt="Keptn-Setup" src="img\9f667dd2fececa10.png"> Take note of to append &#34;<strong>/swagger-ui/</strong>&#34; to the end to view the Keptn API Swagger UI</p>
<p><img alt="Keptn-Setup" src="img\cc17d4a8ba873695.png"> There would be no project running at the moment on Keptn&#39;s bridge, but we will be creating at the next step.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Configuring Keptn within Jenkins" duration="5">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Setting up Keptn Plugin within Jenkins</h2>
<p>Back within Jenkins, select <strong>Jenkins (from the top left) &gt; Manage Jenkins &gt; Configure System</strong></p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Plugin-Setup" src="img\3f3d2f28032c118f.png"></p>
<p>Scroll down and under &#34;<strong>Global Properties</strong>&#34; enter the KEPTN API Token from the Terminal into the field<br> Click &#34;<strong>Save</strong>&#34; to save your setting.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Plugin-Setup" src="img\15bb2746e0c893c9.png"></p>
<p>Steps have been pre-configured prior to the labs. To find out more about the plugin, refer to the <a href="https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/keptn-jenkins-library" target="_blank">Keptn Jenkins Shared Library</a> on Github.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Keptn&#39;s SLI/SLO-based Quality Gates" duration="20">
        <p>We will be using Jenkins Pipeline to triggers an SLI/SLO-based Quality Gate Evaluation in Keptn. This can also be done through the Keptn CLI or the API.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="SLI-quality-gate" src="img\ae7293f03464a97e.gif"></p>
<p>Within Jenkins, mouseover &#34;<strong>01-qualitygate-evaluation</strong>&#34; in the list, click on the down arrow and select &#34;<strong>Build Now</strong>&#34;</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Quality-Gate" src="img\8a8502059a80bd64.png"></p>
<p>The initial build will fail as Jenkins by default doesn&#39;t scan the pipeline for parameters and there are several that have to be specified. Click on &#34;<strong>01-qualitygate-evaluation</strong>&#34; to drill into the pipeline.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Quality-Gate" src="img\120dd8f82562e73e.png"></p>
<p>Click on <strong>&#34;01-qualitygate-evaluation&#34;</strong> and select <strong>&#34;Build with Parameters&#34;</strong> on the left menu.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Quality-Gate" src="img\a8d166e230de069.png"></p>
<p>As with the preconfigured form, we will be using the <strong>&#34;evalservice&#34;</strong> tag within Dynatrace to identify the appropriate service which we will validate the SLI and SLO. The name of the tag can be passed to our Jenkins Pipeline as a parameter. So we will first need to tag a service within Dynatrace.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Login to your Dynatrace Environment</h2>
<p>Access your Jenkins environment via a web browser with credentials from your email. <br> When you access your Dynatrace tenant for the first time you&#39;ll need to set a password.<br></p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Quality-Gate" src="img\3b39f8380e527051.png"></p>
<p>Once you logged into Dynatrace, you will find a preconfigured Dashboard.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Setup Tag within Dynatrace</h2>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Quality-Gate" src="img\485d63efe3c7d03c.png"></p>
<p>This prebuild dashboard will also contain links providing quick access to the various portals.</p>
<p>Select &#34;<strong>Transactions and Services</strong>&#34; on the left navigation bar and select &#34;<strong>front-end</strong>&#34; service. <br> This can be either for Dev or Prod service.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Quality-Gate" src="img\aadc32346ffd9c82.gif"></p>
<p>Drop-down &#34;<strong>Properties and tags</strong>&#34;, Click on &#34;<strong>Add-tag</strong>&#34; and enter &#34;<strong>evalservice</strong>&#34; as tag</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Build the pipeline in Jenkins</h2>
<p>Back in Jenkins, click on &#34;<strong>Build</strong>&#34; button to run the pipeline</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Quality-Gate" src="img\1585be2772adc9e7.png"></p>
<p>Once the pipeline completes, you can see the changes reflected in Keptn&#39;s bridge and Dynatrace.<br> Within Dynatrace, you will also discover a new custom info event.<br> The new event will contain details of the quality gate results with details such as JobURL, JobName from Jenkins as well as Keptn source and Keptn&#39;s bridge.<br> The links will also bring you to Jenkin&#39;s and Keptn&#39;s portals with more detailed information on each side.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Quality-Gate" src="img\4af0bea58fda670d.gif"></p>

      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Jenkins Simple Load Test" duration="20">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Load Testing in Pipeline</h2>
<p>This is an extended version of the previous build where the pipeline also has a very simple load-testing capability built-into one of the stages.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="load-test" src="img\874863104272faea.gif"></p>
<p>Go to &#34;<strong>Transactions and Services</strong>&#34;, filter with &#34;<strong>[Kubernetes]stage:dev</strong>&#34; tag and tag &#34;<strong>testservice</strong>&#34; to identify the service.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="load-test" src="img\78c1d5868c11ecfd.gif"></p>
<p>Back In Jenkins, click on &#34;<strong>Back to Dashboard</strong>&#34; to return to the list of Jenkin&#39;s pipelines.<br> Mouseover &#34;<strong>02-simpletest-qualitygate</strong>&#34; in the list, click on the down arrow and select &#34;<strong>Build Now</strong>&#34;<br> As per the previous lab, the initial build will fail but you can drill into the &#34;<strong>Build with parameters</strong>&#34; on the 2nd attempt.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="load-test" src="img\7252dfeec2bde69a.png"></p>
<p>Change the form with the following details:<br> Service: <strong>testservice<br></strong> DeploymentURI: <strong>Website Dev URL</strong> (as provided in email)<br> URL Paths: <strong>/:homepage;/category.html:Category<br></strong></p>
<p>Once completed, you can click on &#34;<strong>Build</strong>&#34; button to start the pipeline.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="load-test" src="img\a06dbafdb907f8fb.png"></p>
<p>You can also get the URL of your Carts Dev URL from your dashboard.<br> Simply right-click and copy link address.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="load-test" src="img\eb26148763b7ab4c.png"></p>
<p>Once completed, you can look at Keptn&#39;s bridge / Dynatrace&#39;s Frontend Service / Jenkins for the changes.<br> You will find the additional SLIs based on the calculated service metrics.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="load-test" src="img\4a335a7fd9880a7f.png"></p>
<p>To find out more about the setup of this hands-on, the full tutorial could be found <a href="https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/jenkins-tutorial/blob/master/README.md#12-integrate-keptns-slislo-based-quality-gates---with-simple-testing-tool-in-pipeline" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Keptn&#39;s Performance Test Quality Gate" duration="20">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Performance Testing in Pipeline</h2>
<p>This lab extends the previous one where we had Jenkins execute a simple test as part of the Jenkins Pipeline. Keptn was then used for SLI/SLO based quality-gate evaluation. In this tutorial we use Keptn to also take care of the actual test execution using JMeter.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="perf-test" src="img\2bcf8b34937f9f8f.gif"></p>
<p>We will also be using calculated service metrics as defined SLIs for the test execution.<br> The creation of these service metrics was created as part of the lab setup. <br> These metrics could be found in <strong>Settings &gt; Server-side service monitoring &gt; Calculated Service metrics<br></strong></p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="perf-test" src="img\f9b6eb1c09a0c8ec.png"></p>
<p>These metrics as well as their dimensions will be used during the execution of the SLIs. <br> As we already added the &#34;<strong>testservice</strong>&#34; tagged, we can simply run the 3rd pipeline within Jenkins. <br> Back in Jenkins, click on &#34;<strong>03-performancetest-qualitygate</strong>&#34;. <br><br> Change the form with the following details:<br> Service: <strong>testservice<br></strong> DeploymentURI: <strong>Website Dev URL</strong> (as provided in email)</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="perf-test" src="img\853e3bf96d381d02.png"></p>
<p>Once completed, you can click on &#34;<strong>Build</strong>&#34; button to start the pipeline.</p>
<p>You can also get the URL of your Carts Dev URL from your dashboard.<br> Simply right-click and copy link address.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="perf-test" src="img\d23f7359d88397fa.png"></p>
<p>Once completed, you can look at Keptn&#39;s bridge / Dynatrace&#39;s Frontend Service / Jenkins for the changes.<br> Within Dynatrace, you can see the automated performance tests that generated a pass result for the quality gate.<br> You can also drill in context into Keptn&#39;s bridge as well as Jenkins.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="perf-test" src="img\b4d6d670bfd63c1a.gif"></p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Automate SampleApp Deployment" duration="20">
        <p>We will now modify the SampleApp Sockshop by automating it with Keptn&#39;s SLI/SLO-based Quality Gates.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="deploy-app" src="img\73d9583fc386d2a5.png"></p>
<p>Within Jenkins, mouseover &#34;<strong>DeploySockShop</strong>&#34; in the list, click on the down arrow and select &#34;<strong>Configure</strong>&#34;<br> Open another browser tab, go to <a href="https://github.com/Dynatrace-APAC/Workshop-Autonomous-Cloud/blob/master/jenkins/DeploySockShop_Keptn_LoadTest_and_QualityGate.Jenkinsfile" target="_blank">Dynatrace APAC&#39;s Autonomous Cloud&#39;s Git Repo</a>.<br> Copy the <strong>amended SockShop Jenkinsfile raw file</strong> and replace it within the Pipeline section in Jenkins.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="deploy-app" src="img\565ac2a88279616.gif"></p>
<p>Click on &#34;<strong>Save</strong>&#34; and at the &#34;<strong>Build with Parameters</strong>&#34; page, select &#34;<strong>Build Two</strong>&#34; and start the build.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="deploy-app" src="img\cd0aaacd25e6ba4a.png"></p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Self Healing as a Service" duration="20">
        <p>Dynatrace integrates with many runbook automation tools such as Ansible. We&#39;ll be using Ansible to showcase self-healing problems and automate operations.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Generate Load for Carts Service</h2>
<p>Within the SSH terminal, run the following commands to trigger load for the carts service.</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">cd ~acm_student/dtacmworkshop/utils/
sudo ./cartsLoadTest.sh
</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Login to Ansible Tower</h2>
<p>Access your Ansible environment via a web browser with credentials from your email.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Ansible" src="img\2fd8f373915b372b.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Configure Dynatrace Problem Notification</h2>
<p>Within Ansible, click on &#34;<strong>Templates</strong>&#34; on the left navigation and copy the URL for <strong>Remediation</strong> Job template. <br> In the Dynatrace UI, navigate to **Settings &gt; Integration &gt; Problem Notification &gt; Setup Notification &gt; Ansible Tower **<br> Enter the <strong>Ansible Tower job template URL</strong> you copied<br> Enter the credentials to access Ansible (as provided in email)<br> Click the Sent test notification button to validate your configuration<br> On success, a green confirmation message will be displayed<br> Save your configuration</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Ansible" src="img\29f86ae4b544ea8b.gif"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Adjusting Anomaly Detection</h2>
<p>Both problem and anomaly detection in Dynatrace leverage our DAVIS AI technology. This means that DAVIS learns how each and every microservice behaves and baselines them. Therefore, in a demo scenario like we have right now, we have to override the AI engine with user-defined values to allow the creation of problems due to an artificial increase of a failure rate. (Please note: if we would have the application running and simulate end-user traffic for a couple of hours/days there would be no need for this step.)</p>
<p>In your Dynatrace tenant, navigate to &#34;<strong>Transaction &amp; services</strong>&#34; and filter by tag &#34;<strong>[Kubernetes]stage:prod</strong>&#34; and select ItemsController Service<br> Within the ItemsController Service page, click on on the <strong>three dots ( ... )</strong> next to the service name. Click on <strong>Edit<br></strong> On the next screen, edit the <strong>anomaly detection settings</strong> as per below<br></p>
<ul>
<li>Disable <strong>Global anomaly detection</strong></li>
<li>Detect increases in failure rate using <strong>fixed thresholds </strong></li>
<li>Alert if <strong>0 %</strong> custom failure rate threshold is exceed during any 5-minute period.</li>
<li>Set Sensitivity to <strong>High</strong> and change less than the value to <strong>1 request/min</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Ansible" src="img\60b06e9a63493c4f.gif"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Launch remediation playbook</h2>
<p>Navigate back to the Ansible Tower UI. From the side menu, navigate to <strong>Resources -&gt; Templates</strong>.<br> Click on the <strong>rocket icon</strong> to launch the start-campaign playbook. <br> Hit <strong>Next</strong> on the prompt popup window and then <strong>Launch</strong>. <br> As the playbook runs, validate that status is successful.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Ansible" src="img\ef93d54be88c554a.gif"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Observe remediation</h2>
<p>Back in ItemsController, look at the service events. The playbook have notified Dynatrace when the promotional rate was changed to 50%.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Ansible" src="img\81d58e51c4edbf01.png"></p>
<p>You should see the Failure Rate increasing, eventually leading to Dynatrace detecting a Problem You might need to refresh your browser a few times</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Ansible" src="img\93789cb6cd9a0e46.png"></p>
<p>Observe the new problem appearing. The comments section will show the remediation actions taken by Ansible Tower</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Ansible" src="img\7c489032e7a5b792.png"></p>
<p>Drill-down in the Problem. You will see a new configuration change event reported by Ansible Tower The promotional rate has been set back to 0% to remediate to the transaction failures</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Ansible" src="img\5a9b939ace65bffa.png"></p>
<p>Jobs executed in Ansible Tower</p>
<ul>
<li>start-campaign (set rate to 50%)</li>
<li>remediation  <ul>
<li>push comment to Dynatrace Problem</li>
<li>retrieve problem details</li>
<li>launch remediation action related to problem context</li>
<li>update Dynatrace Problem stop-campaign (set rate to 0%)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
